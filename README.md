# Code Painter

[![Build Status][]](http://travis-ci.org/jedhunsaker/codepainter)

Code Painter is a JavaScript beautifier that instead of asking you to manually
specify the desired formatting style, can infer it from a code sample provided
by you. This could, for instance, be a code snippet from the same project that
your new code is supposed to be integrated with.

It uses the excellent [Esprima parser][] by [Ariya Hidayat][] (thanks!).

It also uses [EditorConfig][] to define coding style.

The name is inspired by Word's Format Painter, which does a similar job for
rich text.

## Installation

    $ npm install codepainter

To access the command globally, do a global install:

    $ npm install -g codepainter

*nix users might also have to add the following to their .bashrc file:

    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/npm/bin

## CLI Usage

You can see the usage in the CLI directly by typing `codepaint` or
`codepaint --help`.

```
$ ./bin/codepaint

  Usage: codepaint [options] "glob" ["glob" ...]

  Code Painter x.x.x beautifies JavaScript.

  Options:

    -h, --help                 output usage information
    -V, --version              output the version number
    -i, --infer <path>         code sample to infer
    -p, --predef <name>        specify predefined style (idiomatic|...)
    -j, --json <path>          JSON file with style settings
    -s, --style <key>=<value>  an individual style setting
    -e, --editor-config        enable rules via EditorConfig
    -C, --no-color             disable color escape codes

  Examples:

    $ codepaint "**/*.js"
    $ codepaint "**/*view.js" "**/*model.js"
    $ codepaint -i sample.js "**/*.js"
    $ codepaint -p idiomatic "**/*.js"
    $ codepaint -j custom.json "**/*.js"
    $ codepaint -s quote_type=null "**/*.js"
    $ codepaint -s indent_style=space -s indent_size=4 "**/*.js"
    $ codepaint -e "**/*.js"
```

## CLI Examples

    $ codepaint "**/*.js"

This doesn't transform any files, but it does show you how many files would be
affected by the glob you've provided. Globs absolutely *must* be in quotes or
you will experience unexpected behavior!

    $ codepaint -i infer.js "**/*.js"

Transforms all .js files under the current directory with the style inferred
from infer.js

    $ codepaint -p idiomatic "**/*.js"

Transforms all .js files under the current directory with a Code Painter
pre-defined style. In this case, Idiomatic. The only other pre-defined styles
available at this time are mediawiki and hautelook.

    $ codepaint -j custom.json "**/*.js"

Transforms all .js files under the current directory with a custom style in
JSON format.

    $ codepaint -s indent\_style=space -s indent\_size=4 "**/*.js"

Transforms all .js files under the current directory with 2 settings:
`indent_style=space` and `indent_size=4`. You can specify as many settings as
you want and you can set values to `null` to disable them.

    $ codepaint -e /usr/local/bin/editorconfig "**/*.js"

Transforms all .js files under the current directory with the EditorConfig
settings defined for each individual file.

Refer to [EditorConfig Core Installation][] for installation instructions and
[EditorConfig][] for more information, including how to define and use
`.editorconfig` files.

    $ codepaint -i infer.js -p idiomatic -j custom.json -s end_of_line=null
    -e /usr/local/bin/editorconfig "**/*.js"

As you can see, you can use as many options as you want. Code Painter will
cascade your styles and report how the cascade has been performed, like so:

```
  Inferred style:
   + indent_style = tab
   + insert_final_newline = true
   + quote_type = auto
   + space_after_anonymous_functions = false
   + space_after_control_statements = false
   + spaces_around_operators = false
   + trim_trailing_whitespace = false
   + spaces_in_brackets = false

  hautelook style:
   * indent_style = space
   + indent_size = 4
   * trim_trailing_whitespace = true
   + end_of_line = lf
   = insert_final_newline = true
   = quote_type = auto
   * spaces_around_operators = true
   = space_after_control_statements = false
   = space_after_anonymous_functions = false
   * spaces_in_brackets = hybrid

  Supplied JSON file:
   * space_after_control_statements = true
   = indent_style = space
   * indent_size = 3

  Inline styles:
   x end_of_line = null

  Editor Config:
   + applied on a file-by-file basis

  ...........................

  REPORT: 27 files transformed
```

## Supported Style Properties

1.  **codepaint**: *false*

    Tells CodePainter to skip the file (no formatting). This property really
    only makes sense if you are using the `--editor-config` CLI option. This
    allows you to, for example, skip a vendor scripts directory.

1.  EditorConfig properties: **indent\_style**, **indent\_size**,
    **trim\_trailing\_whitespace** and **insert\_final\_newline**. Refer to
    [EditorConfig's documentation][] for more information.

1.  **quote\_type**: *single*, *double*, *auto*

    Specifies what kind of quoting you would like to use for string literals:

    `console.log("Hello world!")` -> `console.log('Hello world!')`

    Adds proper escaping when necessary, obviously.

    `console.log('Foo "Bar" Baz')` -> `console.log("Foo \"Bar\" Baz")`

    The *auto* setting infers the quoting with a precedence toward *single*
    mode.

    `console.log("Foo \"Bar\" Baz")` -> `console.log('Foo "Bar" Baz')` or
    `console.log('Foo \'Bar\' Baz')` -> `console.log("Foo 'Bar' Baz")`

1.  **space\_after\_control\_statements**: *true*, *false*

    Specifies whether or not there should be a space between if/for/while and
    the following open paren.

    `if(x === 4)` -> `if (x === 4)` or `while (foo()) {` -> `while(foo()) {`

1.  **space\_after\_anonymous\_functions**: *true*, *false*

    Specifies whether or not there should be a space between the `function`
    keyword and the following parens in anonymous functions.

    `function(x) { }` -> `function (x) { }`

1.  **spaces\_around\_operators**: *true*, *false*, *hybrid*

    Specifies whether or not there should be spaces around operators such as
    `+,=,+=,>=,!==`.

    `var x = 4;` -> `var x=4;` or `a>=b` -> `a >= b` or `a>>2` -> `a >> 2`

    *Hybrid* mode is mostly like the *true* setting, except it behaves as
    *false* on operators `*,/,%` and unary operators `!,~,+,-`, not to be
    confused with the `+` and `-` addition and subtraction operators.

    `var x = 4 * 2 + 1 / 7;` -> `var x = 4*2 + 1/7;`

1.  **spaces\_in\_brackets**: *true*, *false*, *hybrid*

    Specifies whether or not there should be spaces inside brackets, which
    includes `(),[],{}`. Empty pairs of brackets will always be shortened.

    `(x===4)` -> `( x===4 )` or `( )` -> `()`

    The *hybrid* setting mostly reflects Idiomatic style. Refer to
    [Idiomatic Style Manifesto][].

## Recommended Use

It is highly recommended that you use the EditorConfig approach to painting
your code. These are the steps you would follow to do so:

1.  Place an `.editorconfig` file at your project root. Refer to this
    project's [.editorconfig][] file for a point of reference as to how this
    might look. You can also scatter `.editorconfig` files elsewhere
    throughout your project to prevent CodePainter from doing any
    transformations (e.g., your vendor scripts folders). In this case, the
    `.editorconfig` file would simply read: `codepaint = false`.

1.  Install CodePainter for global use with `npm install -g codepainter`.

1.  You *could* run `codepaint` manually every time you want to do it, but you
    might find this next `.bashrc` shortcut more useful. The idea is to run
    this `gc` alias to a newly-defined `codepaint_git_commit` function. This,
    you do instead of running `git commit`. The caveat is that you need to
    stage your changes with `git add` before doing so. This is because the
    command runs `codepaint` only on staged `.js` files. Aside from this
    caveat, you can commit things mostly the same as you were used to before.
    Now, `gc` can paint your code before a commit and bail-out of the commit
    if there are issues with the process (e.g., JavaScript parse errors). The
    idea of formatting code before a commit is definitely controversial, but
    if you choose to do so anyway, here's the neat trick to put in your
    `.bashrc` file:

```bash
alias gc=codepaint_git_commit
codepaint_git_commit() {
    # 1. Gets a list of .js files in git staging and sends the list to CodePainter.
    # 2. CodePainter with the -e flag applies rules defined in your EditorConfig file(s).
    # 3. After CodePainter is done, your args are passed to the `git commit` command.
    codepaint -e $(git diff --name-only --cached | egrep '\.js$') && git commit $@
}
```

Any tips on how to improve this process are greatly appreciated. See the
[package.json][] file for contact information.
